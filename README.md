# Ms-Engage Teams Clone
The project was built as a part of the Microsoft Engage '21 Program. Contributors were required to build a clone of the Teams app with the mandatory feature of connecting via video call and incorporate Agile Methodology into our work. Within a span of 4 weeks the participants were also given a adopt phase of incorporating a chat feature. <br />

* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The Backend
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database
* [Peer JS](https://peerjs.com/) - PeerJS simplifies WebRTC peer-to-peer data, video, and audio calls.
* [SocketIo](https://socket.io/) - For realtime communication
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Dependency Management
* [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) - Used to Deploy Node.js applications
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Open-source web application framework for Node.js. It is used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily.

## Getting started 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites 
You have to install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your machine.

### Installing 
After installing node, clone the repo or you can download the zip file
Then open cmd or git bash on the project folder to install some modules that I used to build this project

Install Once

`npm install`

Nodemon For automatically restarting the server as a dev dependency (optional)

`npm i --sav-dev nodemon`

### Running the app 
`node server.js`

## Major Learnings
1. **Agile Methodology**: Through the 4 week span of the project, I undertook weekly sprints and made sure that small features get implemented in an efficient and time bound manner. Having a usable version of the product from the very beginning and seeing it evolve through the days and weeks was a joyful experience.
2. **Perseverance and debugging skills**: Having faced numerous bugs that seemed *impossible* to solve at first to actually overcoming them felt like victory. It improved my problem solving skills and faith in hardwork.
3. **New Technologies**: The project was a fun introduction to webRTC, sockets and databases for me and I thoroughly enjoyed learning the new technologies. With the help of my friends and mentors as well as self study I was able to grow my knowledge.
4. **Growth mindset**: The sessions as well as the project taught me that our skills can be improved and having a growth mindset helps one and their organization in the long run.
